## Step 1: Check Node.js and npm

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following commands to verify that Node.js and npm are installed:
```
  node -v
  npm -v
  npm install
```
- These commands should display the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

## Step 2: Install Vue CLI

- Open a terminal.
- Run the following command to install the Vue CLI globally:
```
  npm install -g @vue/cli
```
- This installs the Vue CLI globally on your machine.
## Step 3: Create a Vue Project

Now that you have Vue CLI installed, you can create a new Vue.js project.

### Create a Vue Project:

- In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
- Run the following command to create a new Vue project (replace "my-vue-project" with your preferred project name):
```
  vue create my-project
```
- Choose the default option for Vue 3.

- Quickly run your Vue application by navigating to the new folder and typing npm run serve to start the web server and open the application in a browser:
```
  cd my-project
  npm run serve
```
- You should see "Welcome to your Vue.js App" on http://localhost:8080 in your browser. You can press Ctrl+C to stop the vue-cli-service server.

## Step 3: Install VS Code Extensions

- **Vetur Extension:**
  The Vetur extension supplies Vue.js language features (syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, snippets, formatting) to VS Code.
- **Vue Language Features (Volar):**
  Vue Language Features is a language support extension built for Vue, Vitepress and petite-vue. this is based on @vue/reactivity to calculate everything on-demand, to implement native TypeScript language service level performance.

## Install Vue Router:
It's possible to create a router by choosing to configure it manually after running the project creation command, or it can also be done through the following steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project's root directory.
2. Run the following command to install Vue Router using the Vue CLI. This command will prompt you with configuration questions; choose options based on your project's needs.
```
  vue add router 
```
- This command will ask you questions to configure Vue Router. Choose options based on your project's needs.

### Manual Installation (if preferred): 
Alternatively, if you prefer manual installation without using the Vue CLI plugin, you can install Vue Router using npm or yarn.
```
 npm install vue-router
```
- Now you have Vue Router installed in your project!
